In this project Dogecoin price prediction and prediction, we use three approaches:
 1. Linear regression 
 2. K-Nearest Neighbour
 3. Support Vector Machine 
 4. Decision Tree

1.Linear regression:
  Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (Y), aiming to find the best-fitting line that describes this relationship.
In simple linear regression, with one independent variable X, the relationship is modeled as:
Y=β0+β1X+ϵ
where:
•	Y is the dependent variable,
•	X is the independent variable,
•	0β0 is the intercept,
•	1β1 is the slope,
•	ϵ is the error term.
The coefficients 0β0 and 1β1 are determined from the data using the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed Y values and the values predicted by the model.
In multiple linear regression, involving multiple independent variables, the relationship is modeled as:
Y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+...+βnXn+ϵ
where 1,2,...,X1,X2,...,Xn are the independent variables, and 0,1,2,...,β0,β1,β2,...,βn are the coefficients.
Linear regression is commonly used for prediction and forecasting in various fields, such as economics, finance, and social sciences.




Advantages of linear regression algorithm: 
Advantages of the linear regression algorithm include its simplicity and interpretability, making it easy to implement and understand. It is efficient to train, especially with large datasets, and it performs well when the data has a linear relationship. Linear regression also handles overfitting relatively well using techniques like dimensionality reduction, regularization, and cross-validation. Additionally, it can be used for extrapolation beyond the dataset, although this should be done cautiously as extrapolation can be unreliable.

2.K-Nearest Neighbour:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a versatile algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning. It falls under the category of instance-based or lazy learning, where the algorithm defers computation until it needs to make a prediction.
In KNN classification, the algorithm assigns a class to a new data point based on the classes of its k nearest neighbors. The value of k is a hyperparameter that needs to be specified. The class that appears most frequently among the k nearest neighbors is assigned to the new data point.
In KNN regression, the algorithm predicts the value of a continuous target variable for a new data point based on the average (or median) of the values of its k nearest neighbors.
One of the key strengths of KNN is its non-parametric nature, as it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution. However, the performance of KNN can be sensitive to the choice of distance metric used to measure the similarity between data points.
KNN is relatively easy to understand and implement, making it a good starting point for beginners in machine learning. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, as it requires calculating the distance between the new data point and all other data points in the training set.

3.Support Vector Machine:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification tasks, though it can also be applied to regression problems. Its main objective is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.
In SVM classification, the algorithm aims to find a hyperplane with the largest margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from each class (support vectors). By maximizing the margin, SVM seeks to improve its generalization to unseen data and enhance its performance.
SVM can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks by using various kernel functions, such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels. These kernels enable SVM to map the input data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes easier to separate the classes.
One of the key advantages of SVM is its ability to handle high-dimensional data and find complex decision boundaries. It is effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples, a scenario known as the "curse of dimensionality."
SVM has been widely used in various fields, including image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics, due to its versatility and performance. However, SVM can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the kernel type and its parameters, and it may not scale well to very large datasets due to its computational complexity.

4.Decision tree:
Decision trees are a versatile and widely used machine learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the input space into regions, with each partition represented by a tree node. At each node, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data based on a certain criterion, such as Gini impurity or information gain.
One of the key advantages of decision trees is their interpretability. The resulting tree structure is easy to understand and can be visualized, making it useful for explaining the model's decision-making process to stakeholders or domain experts.
Decision trees are also robust to outliers and can handle both numerical and categorical data, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. Additionally, they do not require extensive data preprocessing, such as normalization or scaling.
However, decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when they are deep or when the dataset is noisy. Techniques such as pruning, limiting the tree depth, or using ensemble methods like random forests can help mitigate this issue.
In summary, decision trees are a powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithm that can be used for various classification and regression tasks, especially when transparency and interpretability are important.
